# Space-Invaders
This project was made for my Digital Game Development exam using Unity and C# language. <br>
The project is based on the 1978 arcade game Space Invaders made by Tomohiro Nishikado. <br>
I tried to make it similar to the original. <br>
For example I used the original sounds for the aliens, the mothership and the bullets 
but I also <br> added several 8-bit music from others famous games. <br>
The game features two modes: the classic arcade mode and a 4-level mode with a final boss. <br>

#### This is an example of the Main Menu created based on the original Main Menu of the 1978 <br>
